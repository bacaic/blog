We'll cover a simple example of sending a slack message every morning to get the day weather's forecast: min-max temp and an emoji depicting what the sky will be like, using OpenWeatherMap free API.

## Intro
The goal is to create an automated bot that sends weather information every morning on a slack channel with 0 code (or maybe a maximum of 2 lines).
To do so, we're going to use [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/), an automation tool based on a visual interface to query APIs and trigger external tools. See it like a free, highly customizable and self-hosted [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).
Each action is a Node and is connected to another ones/ones with `wires`.

## Install and run
[Node red install doc](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/)

```bash
$ node -v # >=  8.x
$ sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm node-red # install node red globally
$ node-red # will create a ~/.node-red folder to store config & data
```

```console
Welcome to Node-RED
===================
22 Nov 21:53:17 - [info] Node-RED version: v0.19.5
22 Nov 21:53:17 - [info] Node.js  version: v8.12.0
22 Nov 21:53:23 - [info] User directory : /home/florian/.node-red
22 Nov 21:53:23 - [info] Server now running at http://127.0.0.1:1880/
```

Go ahead and open `http://127.0.0.1:1880/`, you'll have an empty flow open by default:

## Discover
Drag n drop an `inject`, a `debug`, connect them together, hit Deploy, click on the blue square on the left of the inject node and open the debug console:
![todo](/assets/images/2018/11/node-red-discovery.png)

This is the very first step! This is what happened:
- `inject` creates a global Javascrippt object `msg` with the key `payload` containing the actual int timestamp
- `inject` sends it to the `Debug`
- `debug` displays in the console the default configured output `msg.payload`

Double-clicking on the Debug node displays the configuration:

## Build the weather bot

### Connect to Open Weather Map

Create API key on [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org) and use it in the following endpoint:

`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=Paris,fr&appid=[APP_ID]&units=metric`

Default call for testing [https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22](https://samples.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=b6907d289e10d714a6e88b30761fae22)

Look for the node `http request`, set the endpoint and change the return to be a JSON object:
![todo](/assets/images/2018/11/node-red-http-request.png)

Deploy and run!

And it took what, 5 min? Sweeet...

### Format

Use the `template` node a little bit of moustache templating and here we are:

```js
{ {payload.main.temp_min}}/{ {payload.main.temp_max}}
```

### Send to Slack

Install the [Node red slack module](https://flows.nodered.org/node/node-red-contrib-slack)

```bash
npm install node-red-contrib-slack
```

Make sure you have a webhook configured on your slack, i.e. [https://my_instance.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations](https://floriancourgey.slack.com/apps/manage/custom-integrations):
![todo](/assets/images/2018/11/slack-webhook-config.png)

And use the `slack` node with the correct Webhook URL:

### CRON it with Node RED

Think of using it on a daily basis? Node RED has a much easier system than Linux's CRONs.

Open up the `inject` node and define the Regular setting.

## Conclusion

You now have a fully working bot sending weather information every morning! Going further: display an emoji based on `payload.weather[0].id` (see [https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions](https://openweathermap.org/weather-conditions)), connect to your home IoT, your [smart mirror](https://www.google.fr/search?q=iot+smart+mirror&source=lnms&tbm=isch)...
