## Commits are prefixed
Use the following prefixes:
- \+ for a new feature
- \* for an improvement of an existing feature
- \! for a fix

Examples:

|Commit name|Translation|
|-|-|
|+ header|Added the header feature|
|* README with contributors name|Updated README with names|
|! JIRA 136|Fixed JIRA issue #136|

## Commits convention
Commits should be as atomic as possible.
