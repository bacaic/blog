## Generate your public key and add it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

Generate your SSH public key locally, it looks like this:
```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQA+really+long+string myUser@myMachine
```

Then create a JS activity with this code:
```js
var res = execCommand("cd && mkdir .ssh && touch .ssh/authorized_keys", true);
logInfo(res);
var key = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQA+really+long+string myUser@myMachine";
var cmd = "echo '"+key+"' > .ssh/authorized_keys";
var res = execCommand("cd && "+cmd, true);
logInfo(res);
```

That's it! You can now connect by SSH to your ACC server:
```bash
$ ssh neolane@mkt-stage1.campaign.adobe.com
