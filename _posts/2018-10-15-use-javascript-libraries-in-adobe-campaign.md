Ever wanted to use MomentJS or Lodash in your JS scripts? It&#8217;s easy to include them via a CDN for client-side web apps, but it can get tricky to get them for server-side processing. This tutorial walks you through the installation of Javascript libraries for Server Side use.

<!--more-->

Copy the source code of your library, such as Moment hereÂ https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/moment@2.22.2/min/moment.min.js

Go to your Javascript Codes and create a new one labelled &#8220;vendor:moment&#8221;. Paste the code you just copied:

Save it.

Now in a workflow you can use it as any other standard library:
