Send a daily alert if some of your critical workflows are not running (status is paused, failed, restart required..).

## Workflow set up
The workflow runs daily @ 9AM and consists of a Scheduler, a Query on workflows, a Javascript activity and an Email Alert:

## Query set up
The query is based on `xtk:workflow`, where the `state` is different from `Started` and the `internalName` is in a whitelist with `OR` conditions:

Use additional data to add the columns you need to display:

adtl data

You can use `@folderLabel` for the Folder Label alias.

## Test activity set up
The test activity performs a simple test on `vars.recCount > 0` without the default connection:

## Javascript activity
The JS builds an HTML table based on the query results:
```js
var query = NLWS.xtkQueryDef.create({queryDef: {
  schema: vars.targetSchema, operation: "select",
  select: { node: [
    {expr: "@internalName"},
    {expr: "@label"},
    {expr: "@folderLabel"},
    {expr: "@lastStart"},
    {expr: "@state"},
  ]},
  orderBy: { node: [{expr:"@label", sortDesc:"false"}] }
}});
var records = query.ExecuteQuery();

vars.htmlEmail = '';
vars.htmlEmail += '<table border="1"><thead>';
vars.htmlEmail += '<tr><th>internalName</th><th>Label</th><th>State</th><th>Last Start</th><th>Folder</th></tr>';
vars.htmlEmail += '</thead><tbody>';
for each(var record in records.getElements()){
  vars.htmlEmail += '<tr>';
  vars.htmlEmail += '<td>'+record.$internalName+'</td>';
  vars.htmlEmail += '<td>'+record.$label+'</td>';
  vars.htmlEmail += '<td>'+record.$state+'</td>';
  vars.htmlEmail += '<td>'+record.$lastStart+'</td>';
  vars.htmlEmail += '<td>'+record.$folderLabel+'</td>';
  vars.htmlEmail += '</tr>';
}
vars.htmlEmail += '</tbody></table>';
```

## Email activity

The email uses `vars.recCount` and `vars.htmlEmail`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<HTML><HEAD>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
