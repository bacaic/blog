## Adobe Community Advisor 2021 announcement

Adobe announced on September 2, 2021 the public list of the 80 official Adobe Advisors in a [post on their own blog](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/09/02/introducing-the-2021-adobe-community-advisors.html).

The Adobe Experience League has been created to promote sharing between Experts, Beginners, End-Users & Admins for Adobe Experience Cloud Products. It's a common place where one can find Help, Training and Community on [Adobe Campaign](https://business.adobe.com/products/campaign/adobe-campaign.html), [Adobe Target](https://business.adobe.com/products/target/adobe-target.html) and [Adobe Analytics](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/adobe-analytics.html) (to name a few..).

I've helped many Business & Personal customers in any way I could during the past years for the CRM Product Adobe Campaign. Get to know more about [Adobe Campaign on this blog]({% post_url 2019/2019-05-15-intro-adobe-campaign %})!

After many posts, answers & ideas, my profile is now listed among Advisors from different Tech Companies such as Expedia, Vimeo and Capegemini:
