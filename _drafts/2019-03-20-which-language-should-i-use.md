## Use h2 for each section
- Python: good for small scripts (web scraping, mathematics algo), learning (used in University, High School..), performance, image manipulation - used by Blender and Python
- Java: good for strong-typed applications that require to enforce in/out parameters, mostly for Enteprise-grade and large projects
- Groovy: good for small scripts when coming from the Java environment, POC for Java apps, etc
- Node JS: good for concurrency and parallel calls
- PHP: good for learning and small websites as most hosting providers have PHP enabled by default
- Electron:
- C#: good for interaction with Microsoft softwares/services, can use MS APIs, dlls, Microsoft Office bridges, etc
- C++: good for Windows video games
- C: good for embedded devices that run with very low memory (arduino, military/lunar devices) and need very specific memory management (custom garbage collector, etc)
